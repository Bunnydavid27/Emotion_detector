# Emotion_detector

Emotion detection model that analyses and categorises emotions in textual input. The model can properly recognise and categorise emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and others by leveraging cutting-edge approaches in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The repository contains a large amount of code and materials, making it a great resource for anyone looking to learn, implement, or improve emotion detection capabilities in their own projects.
