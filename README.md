Emotion Emoji Detector is a system that uses Machine Learning (ML) models and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically recognise and correlate specific emotions and corresponding emojis in text. ML algorithms and NLP approaches are used to analyse textual material and predict the matching emotion emojis that best capture the underlying sentiment or feeling portrayed in the text.
