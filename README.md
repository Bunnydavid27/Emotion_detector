Emotion Emoji Detector employing Machine Learning (ML) models and Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a system that seeks to automatically recognise and link specific emotions and corresponding emojis of text. ML algorithms and NLP approaches are used to analyse the textual content and forecast the matching emotion emojis that best capture the underlying sentiment or feeling portrayed in the text.
